# Bamboo Invoice

Originally created by Derek Allard, Bamboo Invoice is free Open Source invoicing software intended for small businesses and independent contractors. Built on CodeIgniter, its priorities are ease of use, user-interface, and beautiful code.

Though the original project is no longer maintained, for reasons of nostalgia and a renewed personal use for the simple functionality of BambooInvoice I've under taken updating it to be once again fully functional. This fork updates the application to CodeIgniter v.3.1.7, and is proven functional using PHP ~7.0. 

### Prerequisites

Web Server configured with both PHP & a relational database, MySQL by default, though many other varieties are supported. View CodeIgniter documentation for more information.
